## About me
I'm a software developer and I live in Bor√•s, Sweden. I read all my emails and try to respond to them within a timely manner. I'm the author of [An API Of Ice And Fire](https://anapioficeandfire.com) which has gotten a decent amount of press coverage over the years.

I like dabbling with all sorts of technologies and love learning new stuff. I love all sorts of music and I'm passionate about football (soccer for you americans out there).
