[Cashew](https://github.com/joakimskoog/Cashew) is a simple and elegant yet powerful HTTP client cache for .NET. I created it to simplify caching of HTTP responses in the widely used HttpClient.









<!-- 
Cashew is a .NET library for caching responses easily with an HttpClient through an API that is simple and elegant yet powerful. There's support out of the box for the awesome CacheManager via the Cashew.Adapters.CacheManager package. Its aim is to focus on the HTTP part of caching and not worrying about how stuff is stored, meaning no half-arsed cache implementations! -->
